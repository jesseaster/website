        <p>
            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an
            area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and includes both
            sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests,
            and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano.
            The volcano is lava only and is no risk to the population. Taniti has
            an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism,
            most of the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

        <h2>Planning Ahead</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Power outlets are 120 volts (the same as in the United States).</li>
            <li>
                Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of
                midnight and 9:00 a.m.
            </li>
            <li>The drinking age on Taniti is 18 and the drinking age is not strictly enforced.</li>
            <li>
                Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English. Very little English is spoken
                in rural areas, especially by the older residents.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is one hospital and several clinics.
                The hospital has many multilingual employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases,
                there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist
                attractions and restaurants will be closed on holidays, so visitors
                should plan accordingly.

            </li>
            <li>
                Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also
                accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange,
                and many businesses accept major credit cards.
