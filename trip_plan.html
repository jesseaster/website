        <h2>Getting To The Island</h2>
        <p>
            Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on
            a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week.
            Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and
            propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so
            larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.

            Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day.
            Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City,
            and rental cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport.
            Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors
            (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable.
            Many tourists stay in the area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy
            to explore on foot.

        <h2>Things To Do</h2>
        <h3>Entertainment</h3>
        <p>
            Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the rainforest,
            and to visit the volcano. However, there are other things to do, including
            visiting a local history museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling,
            zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs, including a microbrewery,
            dancing at a new dance club, seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing
            at an arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a nine-hole golf course
            should be operational by next year. Many of these activities are located in
            Merriton Landing, which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of
            Yellow Leaf Bay.
        </p>
        <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
        <p>
            Most tourists spend most of their time in Taniti City, which boasts
            native architecture and nearby white, sandy beaches that encircle Yellow
            Leaf Bay. Other popular activities include boat or bus tours of the island,
            hikes in the rainforest, or visits to Tanitiâ€™s active volcano.
        </p>
